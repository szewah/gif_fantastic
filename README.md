## Built with
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, GIPHY API

## Here's how the app works
The user inputs a keyword which creates a button that they can then press to return their gifs. On reloading, the page will clear 
the added buttons.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to GIPHY for the use of its API and the instructors and teaching assistants at Columbia Univeristy Coding Bootcamp.
